# Mental Health Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment scores from text data related to mental health. The analysis incorporates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify patterns and correlations between sentiment, text features, and mental health categories.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Removal of noise and preparation of text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Scoring statements based on their sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **Text Features Analysis**: Exploration of text length, word count, and their correlation with sentiment.
- **Visualization**:
  - Distribution of sentiment scores.
  - Relationships between sentiment and mental health statuses.
  - Word clouds for sentiment categories.
  - Scatter plots and pairwise relationships of features.
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Identification of the most frequent words in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
  - Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations.
  - WordCloud for generating word clouds.
  - Counter from collections for word frequency analysis.

## Visualizations
- Pie Charts: Sentiment category distribution.
- Bar Charts: Most frequent words and average sentiment by mental health status.
- Heatmaps: Correlations between numerical features.
- Word Clouds: Frequent words for each sentiment category.

## Results
The project provides insights into how sentiment varies across mental health statuses and text features. It highlights relationships and trends that can inform further research or interventions.
